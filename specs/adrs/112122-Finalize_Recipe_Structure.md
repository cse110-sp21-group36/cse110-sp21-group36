# Finalize Recipe Structure

## Context and Problem Statement

We have been debating whether to use 2 types of recipe structures in our latest meeting on 11/21/22. The problem arose as a result of miscommunication on the structure of the recipe objects, so the Editor Page Team had a different format than the other teams.

## Considered Options

 - We could stick with the current Recipe Structure:

  - **PROS**: The Home Page and Viewer Page already use this format, so we have less to change overall.  
  - **CONS**: There is less information types, which is easier to program, but less dynamic for the users.  

 - We could change the other pages to match the Recipe Editor Page:

  - **PROS**: Less work to fix the Recipe Editor Format.  
  - **CONS**: We have to change the View Page and the Home Page display formats to align with this style.  

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** We've decided to stick with the current recipe structure, which will be the final structure for the recipes we store in our app. We first decided on this format during the Week 7 meeting, and it makes the most sense to stick with a more tested data structure than to switch to a new one this late in the project.
