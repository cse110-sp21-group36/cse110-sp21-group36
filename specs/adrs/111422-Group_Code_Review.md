# Group Code Review

## Context and Problem Statement

Should we use Pair Programming or another method to ensure better code quality?
Having more people look at the code will make it so less mistakes occur while developing.

## Considered Options

* We could work in 5 groups of 2-3 people who would review their partners' code as its being written, so traditional pair programming.
  * **PROS**: This is a proven method of co-development, and has a lot of information on how to do it correctly.
  * **CONS**: This would clash with our already existing method of team-division based on the recipe pages; would we want the pairs to be within only the sub-groups? Or have people across our teams work in pairs? It seems like either way we would miss a lot of input from other group members

* We could do our code reviews and refactoring as a team during our Thursday meetings.
  * **PROS**: This would give a chance for group input as an entire team, so everyone can get a say in what comes into the repo regarding code quality. This would benefit the social aspect of code reviews, as if everyone's code gets reviewed at the same time, people wont feel like they're being soloed out by 1-2 partners.
  * **CONS**: We can only do this once week, since that's when we meet as a group.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** We've decided to incorporate code reviews into our Thursday meetings in order to ensure better code quality. We also are using Linters as well as Pull Requests to have as much quality in our code as possible.
