      "mealType": [Multiple Values],                 // Array of Strings, but specifily limited to ["Breakfast", "Lunch", etc.], if you get passed ["Dinner"], then that is the only meal type for that specific recipe; they can also have more than one.
      "totalTime": num#,                             // Number
      "ingredients": [String Array],                 // An array of Strings e.g. ["Carrots", "
