## Live Deployment Branch v 1.0
This is the first Release of the Recipe Creator Application. Almost all of the planned functionality in the Minimum Viable Product has been acheived by our work over the course of 3 Agile Sprints. This is most likely the final version of the website.

## Known Bugs
- There is currently an issue where if an image is uploaded to the page and the image size is too large, when clicking the save button instead of redirecting back to the Home Page, there will be an error like url-too-long or I/O error. **This does not affect functionality** if you manually click the back arrow and go to recipe-manager.html all changes should be saved on there.

### Notes About Live Deployment:
* Team Agenda and Better Information will be on main branch.
* The purpose for seperating the Live Deployment Branch from Main, is so we can have our developers be able to continuously pull and push to our working branch on Main without affecting deployment to end users whom can still access the branch from here on Live-Deployment.
