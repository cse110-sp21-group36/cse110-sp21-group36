## Meeting Agenda
- Take attendance
- Brainstorm ideas for the project
- Changing logo (discuss later with Meron)
- Remind everyone to fill out Daily Standup on Slack
- Decide a date for the brainstorming meeting

## Project Idea Brainstorming: 
- Create a CRUD app like recipe book, 
- Discuss topic for project:
    * blog type website (suggested by Triston)
    * Rappel have a prototype figma app to share images and how you feel.
        * We like Rappel's idea but it is hard to execute for a CRUD app since we won't be able to clearly update/delete. 
    * Default idea: recipe app (suggested by Miko) 
        * easy to do and fulfill the CRUD requirement
        * create a recipe site where it shows different images, and when we click on the image it show  detailed steps 
        * if we have extra time, we can implement Triston's idea for the recipe app (Terraria feature) / share file to social media / etc. 
      
### For later:
 * Discuss on user audience
 * Choose a HTML framework? (Rappel have experience with React, but it will be difficult to get everyone to learn new material)
 * Data storage for the project?

### Decisions:
- Set on the idea to build a recipe book (not final)
- Meet on Sunday, 10/23 around 8 p.m. to further discuss our project idea (Brainstorming Meeting)
