## Goals by Next Meeting
 - Each sub-group in the team structure is expected to have made very good progress if not finished the tasks assigned to them by Thursday's Meeting.
 - If we are on schedule by Thursday, the rest of the project time can be used for fixing styling/linting/debugging errors in our project code.
