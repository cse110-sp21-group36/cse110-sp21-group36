## Meeting Agenda
- Take attendance
- Review Project Pitch and comments by Allison 
- Plan additional Meetings times


## Project
- changing project architecture 
    - idea: proposing a folder per page 
        - might not work since our project generates new html pages 
            - rather than create new html page, use a template and simply load recipe info
    - idea: all javascript together, all css together, all html together 
- documentation 
    - camel case, line limit should be 100 
    - html: 
        - header for each file 
    - javascript: 
        - comment before any function, method header, summary of functions before 
    - create a template for reference 
- GitHub issue board 
    - completing GitHub issue review 

## Team organization 
- Break up between pages, but not restrict developers to a certain language 
    - 3 main pages (3 groups of 4)
- more meetings suggested by allison 
    - more frequent check in to see what people are doing 
    - monday/sunday 
    - send out a when to meet since some are not present 

### Plan Ahead 
- subgroups organize meetings and page specific decisions

### Decisions:
- not restricting developers, free rein on division of files/tasks within groups 
- Group Divisions
    - Home Page: Miko, Duc, Triston, Andy
    - Recipe Editor Page: Meron, Thanh, Ettore, Jiancheng 
    - Recipe View Page (template):  Justin, Julia, Rappal 
- General Aesthetics: two-toned
