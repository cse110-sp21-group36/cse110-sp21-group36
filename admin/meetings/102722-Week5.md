## Meeting Agenda
- Take attendance
- Project Pitch
- Deciding when to do project pitch


## Project Pitch (Do Less!) 
- Project scope: What should project be required to do.
- Need to turn in presentation OR PDF with Wireframe
- Focus on implementing main idea that is necessary
- Miko & Meron Question: What database to use? 
- Store data in local drive, perhaps: CSV, or library

## Project
- Scope, risk, time, rabbitholes
- Rabbitholes: "What we don't have figured out?"

## Team breakdown
- Miko: Suggests to not split up team of HTML CSS and Javascript, wants to work on one webpage at a time
- Meron: Javascript will probably need a lot of work. Wants to make team fluid so that project connects.
- Triston: Maybe we can create and RnD team?

## Planning Ahead
- Team selection: HTML, CSS, Javascript team
- Create google slide presentation

## Potential Rabbitholes
- Do not know how to store data
- How to export data to save and share recipes?
- Express generator: to set up file system - https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html


### Decisions:
- Create google slides and start working on pitch
- Plan to do project pitch one either Monday or Tuesday
