## Meeting Agenda
- Take attendance
- Discuss recipe object structure
- Review Progress of Editor, Home, and View page teams

## Recipe Object Format (Javascript)
- Since all of our project web pages will be accessing a recipe data object in some shape or form, we wanted to come up with a definitive recipe object data type, this way our javascript will have less conflicts.
- We reworked the recipe object to thist new format:

```
Recipe {
      imgSrc": "This is an absolute path on user's cpu",    // String that needs parsed to get URL
      recipeName": "String",                         // Single String
      "mealType": [Multiple Values],                 // Array of Strings, but specifily limited to ["Breakfast", "Lunch", etc.], if you get passed ["Dinner"], then that is the only meal type for that specific recipe; they can also have more than one.
      "totalTime": num#,                             // Number
      "ingredients": [String Array],                 // An array of Strings e.g. ["Carrots", "
       “steps”: [String Array]                       // An array of Strings e.g. ["Step 1: Add Water", "Step 2: Boil", ... ]
       "favorite": True/False                        // Boolean
       "tools": [String Array]                       // Tools: ["Frying Pan", "Beaker", "Blow Torch", ... ]
       "difficulty": "String"                        // A string, under <30 Characters e.g. "Medium", "Hard", etc.
       "notes": "String"                             // Single String, stores additional notes
}
```

## Testing
- Added HTML markup validation to testing
- Could test with Selenium to simulate user navigating page
- Using github super-linter

## Testing Pyramid
- From Base of pyramid to Peak:
- Unit tests, service test, UI tests

## Project Timeline
- We are on schedule, but in danger of falling behind if we don't keep making steady progress

## Code Reviews
- We will do full team code reviews each meeting monday and thursday instead of something like pair programming
