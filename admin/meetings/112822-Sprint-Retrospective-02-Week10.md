## Meeting Notes
* Reviewed the MVP. Only thing we're missing is the delete functionality. We have a search bar criteria in our MVP which we have not fulfilled yet. However, we suggested that we should talk to the TA about not being able to fulfill this criteria later. Additionally, we need to see if all browsers can load the webpages.

​## Retrospective
   - Malcolm is our new TA. 
   - Editor and view pages are nearly finished, but most of the work left is on the home page.

​
## Thoughts going forward
* Now that we're near the deadline, we go through features that are needed to be completed and split up teams to work on each feature: 
   - delete recipe (priority)
   - styling (priority)
   - get navbar working on all pages (priority)
   - sort by favorite 
   - search bar
